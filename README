LibMemC is a small C library which
provides routines for allocating an
aligned memory and implementing
an arena, or region-based memory
management.

The library's file is `libmemc.a`
and its header is `memc_export.h`.
This header file's comments can serve as a short introduction
to the library's API. File `test.c` is a demo file which
demonstrates how to use each function
from the API. To see how to compile your
code for use with the library, look at
script `maketest.sh`

To compile the library, you can use either
the provided `Makefile` or script `makelib.sh`.
To compile the demo file , you can use
script `maketest.sh`. Script `runtest.sh`
invokes the compiled demo program thru valgrind.
